			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The word 'than' is comparative and correctly completes the phrase '...she works harder than anyone I know'.  The word 'then' is sequential and the word 'the' is an article that doesn't make sense grammatically in the blank space.  Hence, 'B) than' is the correct answer."

			explanation: "'Her' children are probably adults or are of working age since 'She' is driving her kids to work every day.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) to'.  The word 'at' makes sense, but still sounds odd.  It makes clear and logical sense to have the completed sentence be: 'She drives her children to work every day'."

			xplanation: "The word 'then' is used to indicate a sequence of events in time.  In this case, the word 'then' is used to connect the group's trip to the library and 'then' their trip to the park afterwards.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) then'."

			correctAnswer: 1,

			explanation: "The word 'stayed' is the past participle of the verb 'stay'.  It is used in the present perfect tense ('have stayed') to indicate an event that has occurred at least once in the past and implies that the event may (or may not) continue in the future.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) stayed'."

			explanation: "'Since' is used to indicate a cause or reason.  In this sentence, it implies that because they missed their flight (the cause), they missed the wedding (the effect).  'Since' is used to show that the missed flight directly led to the missed wedding.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) Since'."

			],
			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The phrase 'used to' is a phrase that refers to something that was true in the past, but is no longer the case.  In this sentence, 'Food used to be much cheaper...' indicates that food was cheaper in the past (and it's obviously more expensive now).  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) used'."

			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The sentence refers to 'the best strategy', which features the singular noun 'strategy'.  Therefore, 'A) was' is the correct answer since it agrees with the singular subject 'strategy'."

				"C) Didn't"
			],
			correctAnswer: 2,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The correct answer is 'Didn't' because if you move the words around, the incorrect phrases would be 'They hadn't want to come over today' or 'They haven't want to come over today'.  Instead, the correct declarative statement with the words of the question reordered is: 'They didn't want to come over today.'  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) Didn't'."

			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The phrases 'Why haven't you apply…?' and 'Why aren't you apply…?' don't make grammatical sense.  It should be 'Why haven't you applied…?' or 'Why aren't you applying…?'  The correct complete sentence is 'Why don't you apply for that job we saw the ad for yesterday?'  Hence, the correct answer is: 'A) don't'."

			choices: ["A) hundred",
				"B) zero-zero",
				"C) hundreds"
			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "When specifying an exact amount of money like '$300,' 'hundred' is correct for exact amounts.  'Zero-zero' is not a proper way to refer to numerical amounts.  The word 'hundreds' is used for approximate figures (e.g. 'hundreds of dollars'), but is not used for exact amounts like '$300'."

				"B) haven't",
				"C) isn't"
			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The answer choice 'A) hadn't' works here because the sentence talks about something that already happened in the past ('wouldn't have gotten…a ticket') and imagines how it could have been avoided.  The word 'haven't' is wrong because it refers to the present tense.  The word 'isn't' is also wrong because it refers to the present tense."

				"C) was writing"
			],
			correctAnswer: 2,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The answer choice 'C) was writing' is correct because it describes an action or event that started in the past and may be resumed in the future ('I am half-way done with it.').  The word 'wrote' is wrong because it suggests the story is already finished (the event started and ended in the past) while the word 'writing' is wrong because it doesn’t make grammatical sense."

			choices: ["A) in",
				"B) on",
				"C) over"
			],
			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The phrase 'try on clothes' is the correct phrasal verb used when referring to testing clothes for fit before buying them.  The phrases 'try in clothes' and 'try over clothes' are incorrect as they aren't phrases that make sense in common everyday English."

				"B) asked",
				"C) told"
			],
			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The past tense verb 'asked' is correct here because the sentence describes something the instructor did in the past and makes clear logical and grammatical sense.  The word 'ask' is present tense and doesn’t make grammatical sense while 'told' would have made sense if the sentence were something like: 'My instructor told the class that we should feel ready for the test on Friday since we all did well on the Practice Test.'  Hence, the correct answer choice is: 'B) asked'."

				"B) studying",
				"C) to study"
			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The main verb 'study' is correct after the modal verb 'might'.  The word 'studying' is incorrect because it is a present participle ('might' does not pair with present participles) and 'to study' is incorrect because 'might' does not pair with the infinitive form."

				"B) weren't",
				"C) aren't"
			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The contraction 'won't' ('will not') is correct here as the correct sentence will read: 'The Registrar won't allow me to drop the class since it's after the Class Drop Deadline'.  The other options are incorrect because 'weren't' (past plural form of 'wasn't') and 'aren't' (present plural form of 'isn't') do not make logical or grammatical sense.  Hence, the correct answer is 'A) won't'."

				"B) didn't used to",
				"C) won't use to"
			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The phrase 'didn't use to' correctly expresses a past habit or state that no longer exists.  The phrase 'didn't used to' is incorrect because it's an incorrect spelling of the phrase.  However, the phrase 'used to' is correct ('Food used to be…cheaper…').  The phrase 'won't use to' is grammatically incorrect and should never be used.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'A) didn't use to'."

			question: "The dogs ______ barking incessantly throughout the night.",
			choices: ["A) been",
				"B) have been",
				"C) will have been"
			],
			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The phrase 'have been' is used to describe an action that started in the past and continues up to the present which fits the context of the dogs barking throughout the night (and assumes that it is still nighttime currently).  The word 'been' is incomplete and cannot stand alone without an auxiliary verb.  The phrase 'will have been' refers to a future perfect continuous action and is not suitable for describing something that has already happened.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'have been'."

			question: "My Mother ______ sending me to school with a nutritious lunch until I started buying my lunch at the cafeteria instead.",
			choices: ["A) been",
				"B) had been",
				"C) has been"
			],
			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The correct phrase is 'had been' which is used to describe an action that was happening in the past before something else interrupted that action ('until I started buying my lunch…').  In this case, the action of the speaker's 'Mother' sending the speaker to school with a nutritious lunch occurred before the speaker started buying lunch at the cafeteria.  The answer choice 'A) been' is grammatically incorrect.  If the clause starting with 'until' wasn't a part of the sentence, then 'has been' would be correct: 'My Mother has been sending me to school with a nutritious lunch.'  However, the correct answer choice is 'B) had been' for this specific sentence and the entire correct sentence reads: 'My Mother had been sending me to school with a nutritious lunch until I started buying my lunch at the cafeteria instead'."

			choices: ["A) who",
				"B) that",
				"C) where"
			],
			correctAnswer: 0,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The correct word is 'who', which is used to refer to people.  In this sentence, 'who' introduces the relative clause that provides more information about the grandfather.  The word 'that' can sometimes be used for people, but it is less common in this context, and 'where' is used for places, not people.  The correct sentence is: 'My grandfather, who is a doctor, wants me to follow in his professional footsteps, but I don't like school that much'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'who'."

				"B) was",
				"C) had"
			],
			correctAnswer: 1,
			image: "img/aptis1_q2-25.png",
			explanation: "The correct word is 'was' as the sentence refers to an event that occurred in the past ('struck the tiny country').  The word 'is' refers to present events and 'had' is used in the past perfect tense, which is unnecessary here since the word 'struck' is in the simple past tense.  The correct sentence is: 'There ___ a 7.0 earthquake that struck the tiny country in 2019 right before Covid'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) was'."

			explanation: "The recording is as follows: 'Thank you for calling this house hunting recorded line.  The house currently has renters in it so it is not going to be available for viewing until this Sunday between 2pm to 5pm.  Then it will be available at the same time for the following two days.  Please do not visit the home outside of those times and days as you may be disturbing the renters.  Thank you'.  The message states that the house will be available for viewing 'this Sunday between 2pm and 5pm', and then 'it will be available at the same time for the following two days'.  This means the house will also be available on Monday and Tuesday from 2pm to 5pm.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) this Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday from 2pm to 5pm'."
